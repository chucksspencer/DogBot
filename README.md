An internet-connected dog-treat dispenser on a Raspberry Pi with a stepper motor

This as a fun project inspired by an idea my Daughter had. It consists of a mechanism made from a combination of Legos,
3D printed parts, and a stepper motor controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi hosts a Node.js server with endpoints
that run python scripts that control the motor itself. The front end is a simple mobile-friendly Angular single page 
application. The dispenser has a camera attached, and I experimented with trying to stream video to the web client - 
but the results left much to be desired.

We had a lot of fun tweaking the design of the dispenser. There were many, many iterations. Alas, my best effort only
resulted in it working about 75% of the time without the dog treats getting jammed or stuck in some way. 

The dogs seem to like it pretty well.
